//Output: YOLO
//Explaination: This will now print “YOLO” instead of “YO7679”. 
//It is because the widening primitive conversion happens only when an operator like '+' is present which expects at least an integer on both sides.

//Explaination: When we use double quotes, the text is treated as a string and “YO” is printed, but when we use single quotes,
 //the characters ‘L’ and ‘O’ are converted to int. This is called widening primitive conversion. After conversion to integer, the numbers are added ( ‘L’ is 76 and ‘O’ is 79) and 155 is printed.
